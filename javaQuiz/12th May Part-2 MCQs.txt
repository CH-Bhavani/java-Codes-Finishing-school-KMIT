4) . For designing a normal RDBMS which of the following normal form is considered adequate?

a) 4NF
b) 3NF
c) 2NF
d) 5NF

Answer: b
Explanation: Because most 3NF tables are free of insertion, update, and deletion anomalies,
 an RDBMS table is sometimes regarded as “normalized” if it is in the Third Normal Form.

9)
How can you change "Thomas" into "Michel" in the "LastName" column in the Users table?

A)   UPDATE User SET LastName = 'Thomas' INTO LastName = 'Michel'
B)   MODIFY Users SET LastName = 'Michel' WHERE LastName = 'Thomas'
C)   MODIFY Users SET LastName = 'Thomas' INTO LastName = 'Michel'
D)   UPDATE Users SET LastName = 'Michel' WHERE LastName = 'Thomas'

Ans-D

Explanation: The UPDATE statement is used for modifying the table data by using the SET and WHERE clause. The SET clause is used to change the values of the column specified in the WHERE clause. See the below syntax:

UPDATE table SET column1 = expression1, column2 = expression2,... WHERE conditions


10)  Which of the following are the synonyms for Column and ROW of a table?

    Row = [Tuple, Record]
    Column = [Field, Attribute]
    Row = [Tuple, Attribute]
    Columns = [Field, Record]

A)    1 and 2
B)    3 and 4
C)    Only 1
D)    Only 2

Ans-A



Answer: A

Explanation: In Database Management System (DBMS), we can say that each record is also called a tuple and rows. And each column is called fields and attributes.

1) A linear search algorithm’s complexity would be:

a. O(n2)
b. O(n log n)
c. O(n)
d. O(log n)

Answer: (c) O(n)


2) Which of the following sorting algorithms has the lowest worst-case complexity?

A Merge sort
B Bubble sort
C Quick sort
D Selection sort
 

Ans-A



3) Consider the following function

 int fun(int n) {
    int i, j, k = 0;
    for (i  = n/2; i <= n; i++)
        for (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2)
            k = k + n/2;
    return k;
 }

What is the value returned by the above function?

A O(n^2)
B O(n^2Logn)
C O(n^3)
D O(n^3Logn)

Ans-B

The outer loop runs n / 2 or O(n) times.
The inner loop executes O(Logn) times (note that j is multiplied by 2 at each iteration).
Thus, the statement “k = k + n / 2;” executes O(nLogn) times.
The statement increments the value of k by n / 2. So the value of k becomes n / 2 * O(nLogn)
 which is O(n ^ 2Logn)


4) Consider the following three instructions

    (n + m) ^ k = O(n ^ m), where k and m are constants
    2 ^ (n + 1) = O(2 ^ n)
    2 ^ (2n + 1 ) = O(2 ^ n)

Which of the following statements are correct?

A) 1 and 2
B) 1 and 3
C) 2 and 3
D) 1, 2, and 3

Ans-A

(1) (n + m) ^ k = n ^ k + c1 * n ^ (k – 1) + … k ^ m = O(n ^ k)
(2) 2 ^ (n + 1) = 2 * 2 ^ n = O( 2 ^ n)


5) The result of iterating through a binary search tree is _____?

A) An unsorted list
B) A reverse of the input
C) A sorted list
D) None of the above

Ans-C

The binary search tree gives a sorted list when traversed in order.


6)  In the following gcd() function, we have : n >= m.
int gcd(n,m)
{
  if (n%m ==0) return m;  
  n = n%m;
  return gcd(m, n);
}

How many recursive calls are made by this function?

A) O(logn)
B) O(n)
C) O(loglogn)
D) O(sqrt(n))

Ans-A


7)  Recursion uses more memory space than iterations because _____?

A) It uses the stack instead of the queue.
B) Each recursive call must be stored.
C) Both A and B are true.
D) Aucune de ces réponses n’est vraie.

Ans-B

Recursion uses the stack, but the main reason is that each recursive call must be stored separately in memory.



8) What is the time complexity of the following code?

int count(int n)
{
  int c = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
     for (int j = i; j > 0; j--)
        c = c + 1;
  return c;
}

A) O(n)
B) O(n^2)
C) O(n*Logn)
D) O(n*Logn*Logn)

Ans-B

The time complexity can be calculated by counting the number of times the expression “c = c + 1;” is executed. The expression is executed 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + …. + (n-1) times.

Time complexity = O(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + .. + n-1) = O(n * (n-1) / 2) = O(n ^ 2)  


9)  Linked lists are best suited for ____?

B) Size and constantly changing data
C) All the answers are true
