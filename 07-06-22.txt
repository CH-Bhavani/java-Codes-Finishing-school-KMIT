/*
Tarun is working with Strings.
He will be given two words, in which he has to break each word into two parts
First Word- W1+W2
Second Word - W3+W4 

After breaking each word into two parts, check if the new word can formed in such a way that,
W1+W4 or W2+W3 should be same from left to right (or) right to left. 

if it can be done print 'yes' else print 'no' 

Note - Breaking the words should be done at same index position

When you break a string 's' into s1 and s2 , either s1 or s2 is allowed to be empty. 
For example, if s ="abc" , then "" + "abc" , "a" + "bc" , "ab" + "c" , and "abc" + "" are valid breaks.

input =mortal carrom
output = yes

Break First word ="mortal" and Second word ="carrom" at index 3 as follows:
    First word -> "mor" + "tal", W1 = "mor" and W2 = "tal"
    Second word -> "car" + "rom", W3 = "car" and W4 = "rom"

W1 + W4 = "morrom" is a same from left to right and right to left,so print yes

input =romans carrom
output = no

/*
Given a number print the number of ways to represent the in string format.
given number is between 1 and 26 and these numbers represented as A to Z

example:
input =1176
output =3
1176  can be split three ways 1 1 7 6 or 11 7 6 or 1 17 6 or 1 1 76

AAGF(1 1 7 6), KGF(11 7 6), (AQF)1 17 6 , 1 1 76 is invalid


input=326
output =2 
326 can be split into two ways 3 2 6  or 3 26 or 32 6
CBF(3 2 6) CZ(3 26) only two ways (32 6) not valid split.
