/*


srinivas is trying to rearrange characters in word based on frequency 
of each character repeated number of times in that particular word.

example:
input =stff
output =ffst


input =fffbbb
output =fffbbb

both f and b appear three times , so answer would be fffbbb or bbbfff.
return in insertion order of when they both are same frequency. 
 
input =caAc
output =ccaA
